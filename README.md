# asmbl

## Commands

- __rsm__ to open dosBox in your current folder (if u set path)
- __asm__ to assemble a .s file
- __dbg__ to debug a .exe file

## Lazy trick
We both know u that have not time to lose, so we made for u the "dosboxHere.vbs" which opens dosbox in the current path. The "three-terminal-windows" is now far memory! Copy it in the working directory

## Install
add the ASMBL folder (the one with only executables) to C:\amb_GAS (it must be here to work)




### Optional, add the path to the file
If you want to run the command from the cmd you need to:<br>
add c:\amb_GAS\ASMBL to the PATH variable to use rsm wherever you, to add follow: wanthttps://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/	

all .c file are compiled with gcc in dosbox so they are fine, if you have problem with rsm try to recompile it
